`Reflection`

**•	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

For this course we were presented with different data structures, Hash Table, BST, vector and so on. Our job was to apply the base knowledge of each to open and read a file and output data to the screen, using a user menu.

**•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

Each new week we were shown the inner workings of a new data structure. The first thing I did was begin the zybooks portion, which explained how it all worked. Next, I took some extra time and looked around on the web, stackoverflow mostly, to get a better understanding of what I was dealing with. Coming into this course, I thought storing and sorting as something trivial. But now I can see that one type or another is basically in most applications we use. And choosing the right one can make a world of difference in loads times, not to mention the work load it will put on the processor of the embedded system or pc the app is running on.

**•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

From the very first assignment dealing with working code, I couldn’t get the csv file to open for my program. Again, I posed questions in the discussion forum for the class, but I also spent some time looking around the internet. I realized that the code wasn’t finding the csv file. So, I copied the address where it was saved on pc and made the program call it directly from there. That seemed to work. This same problem happened each assignment, but with this new knowledge, I was able to overcome it. 

**•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

I now understand that there is not just one way to do things. But there is a best way to do it. Knowing how to make an application run at top efficiency is better than simply making it run. I think this idea can be applied in all facets of programming.

**•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

This class has been the first time I’ve had to work on an entire program by myself, not including some early projects from the first few classes in the degree path. But I was a little overwhelmed at first, working on the final project, but realized that I don’t need to feel completely alone while coding. There are others out there who want to help. There are sites that gives tips and hints. And through trial and error I think my abilities have evolved past the point of completely not understanding what I’m doing to having a foothold.
